            <h2>Introduciton</h2>
            <p>
                I am Vladimir Poliak, a third-year Business Technology Management Co-op major. 
                I am eager to learn more about the IT and Management profession with hands-on experience. After graduating with high school honours in business, 
                I genuinely valued my high school co-op experience and want to continue pursuing a similar path in university with your program at your organization. 
                I participated in several Ted Rogers Bootcamps, such as Excel and R Studio, and obtained the Microsoft Office Certification to strengthen my adaptability 
                and problem-solving skills while showing my initiative, self-motivation and organizational skills.
