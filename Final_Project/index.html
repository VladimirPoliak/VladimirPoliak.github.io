                            I am Vladimir Poliak, a third-year Business Technology Management Co-op major. 
                            I am eager to learn more about the IT and Management profession with hands-on experience. 
                            After graduating with high school honours in business, 
                            I genuinely valued my high school co-op experience and want to continue pursuing a similar path in university with your program at your organization. 
                            I participated in several Ted Rogers Bootcamps, such as Excel and R Studio, and obtained the Microsoft Office Certification to strengthen my adaptability 
                            and problem-solving skills while showing my initiative, self-motivation and organizational skills.

                            My experience in high school Co-op taught me about support technician work, such as resetting hard drives, upgrading computers and laying out ethernet cables. In university, I took an IT networking course regarding network infrastructure, which taught me about different aspects of LAN/WAN configurations and wireless networks. I have also completed lots of independent research on fixing circuit boards and other microelectronics.

                            An example of my past Co-op experience is when I participated in a team of full-time employees to deploy new software to all computers in the organization. It required issue resolution through ServiceNow to ensure any problems people experienced with the newly deployed software could be solved in a timely manner. Additionally, knowledge documentation had to be created in relation to the new software, so other technicians would be able to quickly find solutions to common problems.
