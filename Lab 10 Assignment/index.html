            According to Chima Mmeje from MOZ, on-page SEO is optimizing content and HTML elements on a website to increase traffic and relevance on the search engine the website is located. 
            Aside from making your website rank higher on the search engine, it also helps the users searching for your website as it ensures they can easily find the information they are looking for when they search in the search engine. 
            This can be done by writing feature snippets which are summaries on the search engine results page, integrating the correct keywords and title/meta tags, adding links to external websites, and optimizing internal website navigation links. (Mmeje, 2024)

            Brian Dean from BackLinko specifies using the technique of “Broken Link Building,” where the owner of a website reaches out to other website owners and specifies any broken links they have on their page in a list format and then asks them if they would be willing to also link to your website in exchange for having found them the information. 
            It is recommended to send these outreach emails only to active sites as it means the owners will be more likely to add your link reference to their site. (Dean, 2023) 
            Joshua Hardwick from Ahrefs further clarifies that you must make webpages to replace the broken link, but those webpages can link to the main site that you want the traffic to lead to, such as if the webpage is a blog post on a blog. (Hardwick, 2022)

            Cindy Tucker from the University of Georgia mentions that a common method of SEO is to ensure the headlines of posts, articles and websites are optimized by appealing to users and search engines. 
            Some methods are listed, such as adding numbers backed by data, questions, “How-to” guides, “Vs,” and focusing on current trends while adding parenthesis.
            These titles are usually more attention-grabbing and peak users' interest, directly communicate value by providing answers to users' questions, educate users by providing valid data and focus on current events ensuring users will be more likely to interact with the content.

            Zach Paruch from Semrush specifies the use of meta keywords, mentioning that the meta keywords tag itself in HTML has not been used by search engines for page ranking since the early 2000s due to past system abuses, with some engines flagging any metadata keywords as spam. 
            Instead they mention an important focus should be optimizing the title metadata tag as it is the first thing that appears in the search engine results for the user and the meta description which appears below the website title in the search results. 
            It should be ensured they are short to avoid truncation, contain the relevant keywords and ensure it is enticing to click, as mentioned in heading optimization. (Paruch, 2023)

            Marisa Fritzemeier from Viral Solutions specifies that SMO aims to ensure brand visibility on social media. Hashtags are one of the most important methods for SMO, as they are used everywhere. 
            They should be specific to reach a target audience while still remaining short and easily memorable. Additionally, it is beneficial to post using different hashtags that your target audience uses; however, the number of hashtags should be limited to avoid unprofessionalism and clutter. 
            They should also be customized based on the social media platform, as some are used for describing while others for categorizing content and it is important to choose which posts require a hashtag as some might not be substantial enough. (Perron, 2017)

            According to Shopify, an important thing to consider for SMO is ensuring a consistent posting schedule, as most social media websites will promote newer content over older content and ensure users remain engaged with the content. (Shopify Staff, 2024) 
            Adobe further elaborates that users are kept more engaged if an optimized amount of content is posted as it helps build a strong relationship with the target audience; otherwise, they might lose interest if the content is posted intermittently since many other creators are optimizing their positing schedules; if you do not optimize your posting schedule, your audience will most likely be recommended, other creators. 
            Additionally, they mention specific posting times for different websites, such as 1-3 posts daily for TikTok, 3 Tweets daily on Twitter and so on. (Adobe Express, 2023)

            Jefferson Todd Pals explains that another important consideration for SMO is putting buttons on your social media on your website. 
            However, they specify that the linked social media should be related to the website's purpose and that posting links to inactive social media accounts will damage the brand's reputation. 
            However these links will allow more people to discover your website since different people use different social media platforms and offers a way for the audience to interact more with the brand. (Pals, 2023)
            Additionally Mightybytes specifies that adding social media links will make the content more easily shareable as they can directly share to the social media platform they use; however, they might cause privacy concerns and slow down website performance. (Mightybytes, 2022)

        <p>
            Despite it being difficult to choose a course which is most useful, I think the one that will benefit me the most for my desired future career path is

            <br>
            Despite being a difficult course with a lot of technical material, it will be useful for me in the future as I want to pursue a career in IT.

            I have already used some troubleshooting knowledge from the course to solve some technical issues end users were experiencing while I was on my work term.
