        <h3>Most Useful Course</h3>
        <!-- This creates a paragraph with a link in the middle of it.-->
        <p>
            Despite it being difficult to choose a course which is most useful, I think the one that will benefit me the most for my desired future career path is
            <a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/information-technology-management/course-outlines/ITM301.pdf">ITM 301</a>.
            <br>
            Despite being a difficult course with a lot of technical material it will be useful for me in the future as I want to go into a career for IT.
            <br>
            I have already used some troubleshooting knowledge from the course to solve some technical issues end users were experiencing while I was on my work term.
